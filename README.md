# Denoising-ECG-using-Digital-Filter-Wavelet-Transform-ANN
This project compares ECG denoising methods using the MIT-BIH Dataset. It implements FIR/IIR, Adaptive (LMS/RLS), Wavelets, and ANN. By analyzing SNR and RMSE, it shows how AI and Wavelets effectively clean noise while keeping the original heartbeat shape intact
